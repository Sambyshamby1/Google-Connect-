**Refugee Connect - Offline Humanitarian AI Toolkit**

**Purpose**

Refugee Connect provides AI-powered humanitarian assistance that works completely offline in crisis zones. The system uses a portable AI server carried by humanitarian workers to serve refugees and displaced persons who lack reliable internet access.

The core innovation is a Progressive Web App cached on Google.com that automatically discovers local AI stations, enabling immediate access to translation services, legal guidance, medical information, and family reunification tools without requiring internet connectivity.

**Architecture and Workflow**

The system operates through a distributed architecture where the AI processing happens locally while the user interface is cached globally.

**PWA Distribution**: A lightweight Progressive Web App is cached through Google.com, making it available on any device that has previously visited Google in the past six months. This eliminates app installation requirements and ensures broad accessibility.

**Local AI Server**: Humanitarian workers carry portable hardware running Google's Gemma 3n multimodal model. This server creates a local WiFi hotspot and processes all AI requests without external internet dependency.

**Auto-Discovery**: The cached PWA automatically scans common IP ranges to locate nearby AI stations. Once connected, all humanitarian features become available through a simple web interface.

**Offline Operation**: After initial connection, the system maintains full functionality even if internet access is lost. Critical translations, legal information, and medical guidance remain accessible.

**Technical Implementation**

**Backend Server**: Python Flask application serving Gemma 3n through Transformers library. Handles multimodal processing for text, images, and audio input with specialized humanitarian prompts.

**Model Integration**: Direct integration with Kaggle's Gemma 3n E4B model providing multilingual support for Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Pashto, French, German, Spanish, Turkish, and Somali.

**Request Processing**: Priority-based queue system ensuring medical emergencies and legal documentation receive faster processing than general chat requests.

**PWA Infrastructure**: Service worker implementation with aggressive caching, offline fallbacks, and background sync capabilities. Designed for unreliable network conditions.

**Network Discovery**: JavaScript client that probes standard humanitarian network configurations to automatically establish AI server connections.

**Core Features**

**Real-Time Translation**: Bidirectional translation supporting major refugee languages with context-aware humanitarian terminology. Handles legal documents, medical forms, and emergency communications.

**Document Processing**: OCR and analysis of identity documents, asylum applications, and medical records. Extracts key information and identifies missing fields required for legal processes.

**Medical Guidance**: Image analysis for basic medical assessment with multilingual symptom description. Provides immediate guidance while emphasizing the need for professional medical care.

**Legal Rights Information**: Country-specific legal guidance covering asylum procedures, detention rights, interpreter access, and legal aid availability. Includes phonetic pronunciations for key phrases.

**Family Reunification**: AI-powered interview system for separated children with structured questionnaires designed to gather identifying information for family matching.

**Skills Exchange**: Community skill discovery through conversational AI that identifies valuable capabilities and facilitates local resource sharing and bartering systems.

**Emergency Response**: Priority processing for urgent situations with immediate access to critical phrases, emergency contacts, and safety guidance in local languages.

**Educational Support**: Age-appropriate learning materials and AI tutoring assistance for displaced children, with parent guidance for continuing education during displacement.

**Deployment Architecture**

**Hardware Requirements**: Minimum 32GB RAM, modern CPU with GPU acceleration recommended. Tested on Dell OptiPlex systems and NVIDIA Jetson platforms.

**Software Stack**: Ubuntu Linux with Python 3.8+, PyTorch, Transformers, Flask, and Nginx. Automated deployment scripts handle complete system setup.

**Security Model**: Local processing ensures sensitive refugee data never leaves the device. No cloud dependencies or external API calls during operation.

**Scalability**: Single server supports concurrent access from multiple refugees. Load balancing and request queuing prevent system overload during high-demand situations.

**Network Configuration**: Automatic hotspot creation with captive portal detection. Supports both standalone operation and integration with existing humanitarian networks.

**Data Management**: Encrypted local storage for sensitive documents with automatic cleanup policies. No persistent data retention beyond active sessions.

The system addresses the fundamental challenge of providing sophisticated AI assistance in environments where traditional cloud-based solutions fail due to infrastructure limitations.

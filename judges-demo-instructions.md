1. Either run "build-complete-server.sh" in device with Gemma 3n model saved or amend the file paths in the scripts to access Gemma 3n hosted somewhere.
2. Run index.html in the root folder - this will take you to the Google demo page where a simulated Google.com home page with have a cached Google-Connect skeleton app (at the bottom the small "+connect" sign. Click this.
3. This will run a caching sim and then take you to the Google-Connect (Refugee-Connect) home page. From here you can navigate the various features. The app should automatically find the server and any instances of Gemma running within the folders, however, tough to test for every judges setup!

I've enjoyed building this and tried to make it as deployable as possible. It cost me Â£120 retail costs to be able to serve 4 requests at a time tested running around 5 minutes for complex tests. I genuinely believe someone smarter than me could make Google-Connect units able to connect to refugee's phones within a 200m radius and provide slow and steady access to a world class offline LLM for around $40 a pop, providing real world support to refugees. If a skeleton access app is able to be cached in Google.com or the home page, then anyone who has visited Google could potentially have an offline PWA tunnel to a local Google-Connect device giving them full functionality of Gemma in a refugee camp - and Gemma really does provide some pretty class answers to tricky questions so well done there.
